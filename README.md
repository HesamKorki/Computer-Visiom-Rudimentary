*Computer Vision is one of the branches of CS. It is basically a combination of Machine Learning and Image Processing.*
I intend to share my knowledge in this area throughout 12 sessions. One can learn the basics needed for computer vision's related projects with this repository.
This repository provides an introduction to computer vision including fundamentals of image formation, feature detection and matching, and classification. We will develop basic methods for applications that include finding known models in images, image stabilization, automated alignment (eg panoramas), and tracking. We focus less on the machine learning aspect of CV as that is really the classification best learned in an ML course.
We will be using **Python2**, and **OpenCV3**.
This repository is comprised of 12 sessions, and each represents a training part and a task part.
Each one of these sessions helps one to acquire the ability to use one of CV's applications.

## **Training Part**

This part contains introducing helpful packages for each application and explaining fruitful functions.
The codes and the descriptions are presented in the independent README file of each session. Moreover, there will be python files (.py) in the session's directory, if necessary.

## **Task Part**

There is either a single task or multiple tasks in each session. Had you follow the training part thoroughly, you would be able to perform the task. However, there will be a python file named task.py in every directory which contains the answer for those who wants to make sure that they did the task correctly.
